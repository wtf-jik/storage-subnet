# Use this document to specify the minimum compute requirements.
# This document will be used to generate a list of recommended hardware for your subnet.

# This is intended to give a rough estimate of the minimum requirements
# so that the user can make an informed decision about whether or not
# they want to run a miner or validator on their machine.

# NOTE: Specification for miners may be different from validators

version: '1.0' # update this version key as needed, ideally should match your release version
